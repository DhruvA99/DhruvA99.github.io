## **Introduction**

<br />

### **What is a commit message ?**

A commit in GitHub is described as a saved change. A commit explains what changes you made to the project. It records progress and when you push your code to a remote repository(like GitHub, Bitbucket), these changes show up in remote and could mean any additions, deletions, or updates to the files stored in the repository.

<br />

### **Why are good commit messages Important ?** 

<br />

If you try to go to any random Git repository, the is a high chances that the commit messages are more or less a mess.

<br />

These commit messages are difficult to read and understand the motive behind the commits. Not all commit messages look like this though. If we go and check [The Linux kernel](https://rospy-ctrl.hashnode.dev/Link) and [Git ](https://rospy-ctrl.hashnode.dev/Link), they have some of the best written commit messages. The contributors of these repositories know that a well-written Git commit is the best way to communicate with the fellow developers about the various changes to the program.

<br />

1. 1.Good commit messages helps to speed up the reviewing process
2. 2.It helps to write a good release note
3. 3.Helps the future maintainer of the repo to understand why a particular change was made to the code and why a feature was added.

<br />
Bad commit create a vicious cycle: as the commit history is unstructured and inconsitent,one doesn't spend much time using or taking care of it. And because it doesn't get enough time, it remains unstructured and inconsistent. A projects long term success depends on its maintainability which depends on maintainer who depends on project's log.

<br />

A team should agree on a common convention that defines at least these things:

<br />

Style (grammar, punctuations, syntax), Content( information for the body of the message) and Metadata( issuing of tracking ID's, pull request numbers)

<br />

## **Commit Message Format**

<br />

*I am not saying that you have to follow this format to write git messages but having a format helps you to understand the structure of the message and makes it easy to write properly.*

<br />

It consist of three things: header, body and footer(optional).

<br />

#### **Header**

<br />

It contains the type of build messages which we are going to commit. Some examples of the different types are:

<br />

- -feat - A new feature
- -fix - A bug fix
- -docs - Changes in documentation
- -style - Style changes, formatting , missing semicolons or whitespaces i.e. everything related to styling
- -refactor - code changes that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
- -test - Add missing tests
- -chore - changes the build process

<br />

#### **Body**

<br />

Contains a scope(optional) is provided in parentheses after header. It describes the part of code affected by the changes. Subject: The subject contains a short description of the applied changes.

<br />

#### **Footer(Optional)**

<br />

Use to reference issues affected by the code changes. eg "Fixes #20"

e.g.

`feat(ingredient): add ingredient to list button`

`style(navbar): add color to active link`

<br />

In most cases you can leave out the details about how a change has been made as code is self-explanatory in most cases. Just focus on making clear the reasons why the respective change was made and the future contributors and developers(maybe your future self!) will thank you.

<br />

**Happy coding!**
